        <p>
            I started my career in the lab after pursuing a degree in Biochemistry and eventually made my way into the career learning space. Over the years, I have worked in the health, research, education, and career development sectors. I am also a copywriter and copy editor.

            At this point, you must be wondering why I decided to take a class in programming. The answer is quite simple: programming is the career of choice of the future. Why not latch onto it now? Cliche, right? The real reason is: I want to see how best I can tie my interest in biochemistry, technology and people development into the career development process.

            When I am not doing any of the above,  you will find me mentoring young people in the sciences, writing space, or life in general. I love reading, sports, volunteering, and a good laugh. Donâ€™t be surprised to find me sharing memes on social  media.
